The technical workflow for this desertification analysis leveraged the synergy between Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Google Colab, combining cloud-based geospatial processing with local Python-based analysis. Initially, the Earth Engine Python API (ee) was initialized within the Colab environment, establishing a connection to GEE's distributed computing infrastructure. The study area, the Absheron Peninsula, was defined using ee.Geometry.Polygon() to create a bounding box, which was then used to filter all subsequent geospatial operations.
The core dataset comprised Landsat 8 Surface Reflectance Tier 1 imagery, accessed through GEE's data catalog (LANDSAT/LC08/C02/T1_L2 collection). A series of preprocessing steps were implemented, including cloud masking using the QA_PIXEL band and scaling of surface reflectance values. Custom functions were defined to calculate various spectral indices (NDVI, NDWI, NBR, TGSI) and biophysical parameters (LST, albedo) using band math operations. These calculations were applied to the image collection using ee.ImageCollection.map(), efficiently processing the entire time series.
Time series analysis was conducted by reducing the image collections to regional statistics using ee.Reducer functions, with results exported as arrays for further analysis in Python. The Prophet model from Facebook and ARIMA models from statsmodels were employed for time series forecasting, with model fitting and prediction carried out using pandas DataFrames. Visualization of results utilized a combination of matplotlib, seaborn, and plotly libraries, with geemap used for creating interactive maps within the Colab notebook.
Land cover analysis incorporated the ESA WorldCover dataset, accessed through GEE (ESA/WorldCover/v100 collection). Area calculations for different land cover types were performed using ee.Image.pixelArea() and ee.Reducer.sum().group(). Forest cover change analysis utilized the Hansen Global Forest Change dataset (UMD/hansen/global_forest_change_2023_v1_11), with gain and loss areas calculated through similar reduction operations.
Throughout the process, error handling and data validation steps were implemented to ensure the robustness of the analysis pipeline. The integration of ipywidgets allowed for the creation of interactive controls, enabling dynamic parameter adjustments and real-time visualization updates within the Colab environment. This technical approach demonstrated the power of combining GEE's massive data processing capabilities with the flexibility and analytical depth of Python libraries in a cloud-based notebook environment
